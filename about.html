				<h3>Personal</h3>
				
				<p>In order to keep this site current, I'm going to list the year of my birth, and you can do the math.  I was born in 1972.  Betrothed to my lovely wife somewhere around the year 2000 (we're both horrible at remembering when we were married), we have raised our only son together since 1997.  I am a veteran of the U.S. Army and, with the exception of my travels in service, have lived in Ohio almost all of my life.  That could explain why I still play video games at my age.</p>
				
				<p>Actually, I play for the escape.  Games provide a relaxing escape from the responsibilities and stresses of everyday life.  When the world has decided to heave a large pile of excrement upon you, you can take up your axe and become an all-powerful death-dispersing machine.  Hacking up orcs and trolls with an axe does wonders for reducing stress.  But it's not only that. . .it's being whisked away to a realm that could only exist in the imagination.  The worlds created by developers today are more beautiful and pristine than ever.  No reminders of the outside world, at least for a little while.</p>
				
				<p>And I would totally live in the castle in the background, as long as there was an internet connection.</p>
				
				<p>I can be contacted via <a href="mailto:cmdubie@windstream.net?Subject=Guild%20Wars%20Evolution">email</a> if you'd like to drop me a line about the website or anything else.

				<h3>How I Roll</h3>
				
				<p>When I play, I usually do so alone.  Even in todays very popular <abbr title="Massive Multi-Player Online">MMO</abbr>'s, I try to find a way to do as much as I can by myself.  This is one of the main reasons I like Guild Wars so much.  It's not like other games that require hours upon hours of mindless repetition to achieve goals.  There are plenty of things for a single player to do in a short amount of time and still feel like they have achieved something.</p>
				
				<p>My time tends to be limited and I usually don't want to spend a lot of it putting a group together and then coordinating that group to achieve everyone's goals.  I do enough of that in real life.  When I do have the opportunity to play for longer periods of time, however, I don't mind working in groups.  I'll usually just go along with groups goals, not bringing my own agenda, and ask tons of questions because I'm such a noob when it comes to being in a group. =P</p>
				
				<p>When I do have the opportunity to get in a nice long session, I make the most of them.  I have had a few sessions that have lasted from 7 to 16 hours; sitting in front of the computer gaming.  Of course, these are days when I'm off work and the family is out of town.  Granted there haven't been a lot of them, and they are fewer and fewer as I get older, but I can enjoy a good escape.</p>
